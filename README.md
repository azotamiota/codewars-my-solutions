# Codewars Solutions

## This repository contains my solutions for [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) coding challenges.
- Coding challenges are ranked. 
- Ranks indicate the proficiency of users and the difficulty of challenges.
- One of the classes of ranks is called "Kyu", which is divided into 8 levels.
- The increasing order of proficiency/difficulty is: `8 kyu` to `1 kyu`.
- `8 kyu` ranked challenges are the easiest, `1 kyu` ranked ones are the most difficult.
